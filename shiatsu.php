Shiatsu massage therapy relies on the use the fingers, thumbs and palm to apply pressure to various areas of the bodyâ€™s surface to help heal common ailments and conditions, and correct imbalances in the body. Pressure applied to points on the body promotes energy flow and corrects disharmonies throughout the patient's body. In addition to being a deeply relaxing experience, Shiatsu helps relieve stress, treat pain and illness, and contributes to a patient's overall health and wellbeing.<br><br>

Shiatsu regulates the automatic nervous system activity and stimulates the circulatory, lymphatic and hormonal systems. Poor posture, joint problems, sprains, arthritis, sciatica, acute and chronic neck and back pain, sinusitis, and bronchitis are treatable with Shiatsu.<br><br>

Shiatsu massage therapy uses techniques similar to those found in other treatment methods such as osteopathy, lymphatic drainage and physiotherapy. However, Shiatsu practitioners attribute physical health conditions and diseases to blockages and imbalances in the energy flow throughout the body, which differentiates its diagnosis and treatment from other massage therapy modalities.<br><br>

Shiatsu works to improve overall health by affecting the internal energy system. Therapy often results in increased range of motion and improved coordination. Used as either a primary or complementary therapy, Shiatsu combines assisted-stretching techniques and acupressure to restore muscle and bone structure.
