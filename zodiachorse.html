				The Horsesâ€™ Personality: Active, Energetic...
			</font><br>
			<font color="yellow"face="courier" size="4">
				People born in a year of the Horse are extremely animated, active and energetic. Horses love to be in a crowd, and they can usually be seen on such occasions as concerts, theater performances, meetings, sporting events, and parties. With a deft sense of humor, Horses are masters of repartee. They love to take center stage and delight audiences everywhere.
				Sometimes, the Horse is a little self-centered, but it doesn't mean that s/he can not be interested in others' problems. Horses are really more cunning than intelligent, and that is probably why most Horse people lack real confidence.
