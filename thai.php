You lie on a floor mat or on a table wide enough to accommodate the therapist, and you wear loose-fitting clothing (often supplied by the spa), because there’s no way a sheet can stay put during these moves—the therapist might kneel on the back of your legs and pull your arms to arch your back and open your chest, or place her shoulder under your heel to lift your leg and stretch your hamstring. Thai massage also includes deep-pressure point work to stimulate the sen, or the body’s energy pathways.<br><br>

At first a little intense (especially if you’re used to Swedish massage and don’t normally do much stretching) and then relaxing and invigorating. Thai massage reminds you that massage isn’t just pressure applied to you by someone else, but a balancing of the body by limbering joints and loosening muscles through movement and strategic pressure.<br><br>

Unlike Swedish massage, there’s a lot of interaction here between you and your therapist. To move you around the mat efficiently, the Thai massage therapist uses her body to leverage you into the elongating stretches. She’ll also use your body as a tool for deepening them, by sitting on your feet and legs, or pushing or pulling you into twists.
