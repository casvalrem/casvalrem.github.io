Geriatric massage therapy is designed to address the specific needs of the elderly population. This type of massage for the elderly uses gentle and light application of massage techniques and can include passive stretching and a light oil or lotion to permit your muscles to be worked on without causing excessive friction to the skin. These techniques can help enhance blood circulation, combat depression, improve balance and flexibility, reduce the pain of arthritis, increase joint mobility, improve posture, and encourage overall well-being.<br><br>

Geriatric massage can be especially helpful for maintaining and improving overall health as we age. It also has been shown to relieve anxiety and provide comfort, especially to touch-deprived elderly clients.<br><br>

If you have a specific health condition, you should receive permission from your physician to proceed with massage. As with any population, there are certain conditions that are not recommended for massage, hence the importance of communication with your doctor. Once you have obtained permission, be sure to specify your preference for geriatric massage when scheduling your appointment.<br><br>

Helpful Wellness Tip: Many clients who use geriatric massage have a friend or family member join them for their first visit to ensure they have a comfortable and relaxing experience. You may decide what amount of clothing you prefer to wear during your massage. Throughout the session, you will be properly draped or covered-only the area being worked on will be exposed.
