Cupping methods are performed in so many ways. One most common is the fire cupping in which your therapist will put alcohol, herbs, paper on the cup and set it on fire. As the fire goes out, cups are place upside down on your skin.<br><br>

The hot air cools down creating a vacuum inside the cup. This causes your skin to rise as it is being sucked up. Your skin reddens as your blood vessels expand. Generally, the cup is left on skin for about 3 minutes. The modern version of this method utilizes a suction rubber pump instead of fire to create a vacuum.<br><br>

Cupping is commonly used along with massage and acupuncture for effective results. The therapist uses silicone cups. They apply essential oil or cream on the skin and slide the cups on the areas need to be treated then massage with the cupâ€“ usually the back part.<br><br>

Another method is the wet cupping. This is also known as Hijama or medicinal bleeding. This approach creates a mild suction by leaving the cup in place for 3 minutes then the therapist will remove the cup and make a light, tiny cut on your skin. Next is to draw out a small quantity of blood through a second suction.<br><br>

You may need an antibiotic ointment and bandage after this session to prevent infection. Within 10 days your skin should look normal again.<br><br>

You might experience some side effects on your skin after each Ventosa/Cupping session. It is normal to have mild discomfort, burns, or bruises on the areas where the cups touch your skin. Bruises will last for a few days to a couple of weeks but are rarely painful.
