				The Monkey's Traits: Sharp, Smart...
			</font><br>
			<font color="yellow"face="courier" size="4">
				People born in a year of the Monkey have magnetic personalities and are witty and intelligent. Personality traits like mischievousness, curiosity, and cleverness, make them very naughty.

				Monkeys are masters of practical jokes, because they like playing most of the time. Though they don't have bad intentions, their pranks sometimes hurt the feelings of others.

				Monkeys are fast learners and crafty opportunists. They have many interests and need partners who are capable of stimulating them. While some like the eccentric nature of Monkeys, others don't trust their sly, restless, and inquisitive nature.

				Although they are clever and creative, Monkeys can't always exhibit their talents properly. They like to accept challenges and prefer urban life to rural.
