Warm banana leaf strips laced with coconut oil are often run over the body to clear energy blockages, as banana leaves contain both medicinal and herbal elements and are a natural ionizer. Banana leaves also have an antiseptic effect and have been used to help treat illnesses from the flu to sprains and even bone dislocations.<br><br>

Originating in the Philippines, Hilot massage also calls upon the intuition of the therapist or manghihilot, who at the start of each session invokes Divine power and the natural power of the surroundings to provide energy for healing. So too, the clientâ€™s inherent self-healing powers are called to action.<br><br>

Hilot therapists are trained in massage and mind/body connections. Using bare hands to scan the body through touch, as well as various herbs, medicinal plants, and banana leaves, the practitioner diagnoses which areas are energetically imbalanced. Through deep massage, the goal of Hilot treatment is to restore harmony and balance to the body.
